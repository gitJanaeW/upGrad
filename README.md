## 1. UpGrad
UpGrad is a social site that lets grad students connect with their peers to share and collaborate on research together.

#  2. Project Description
“Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress and working together is a success” – Harrison Ford.

UpGrad is a networking and shared research website. It is designed to have students sign up and log in with their email to access a dashboard of current research their peers have posted. The research posts will allow the user to see the students name, institution, research topic and abstract as well as if the project is currently ongoing and whether they are seeking to collaborate with others on it.

Through the dashboard, users can filter through several options to find the types of topics they are interested in reading about and collaborating with. 

Each user will have their own profile page with the ability to add additional research to their page/dashboard and will let others see exactly what they are working on. You can also delete any projects you’ve added. To promote collaboration, there is a message function that will let others email you and connect!

Primary technologies used for this project are as follows:

1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	Javascrip
4.	Node.Js, Express.js, Validate.js
5.	Sequelize
6.	Handlebars template
7.	Sessions
8.	Bootstrap
9.	Deployed VIA Heroku

Challenges encountered was implementation of clean routes to the back-end server and database. Additionally, working with the Handlebars template proved challenging when extracting data.

In the future we hope to implement a more robust chat feature to encourage real-time collaboration. We would want other users to be able to visit other people’s profiles. Another function we’d like to implement is a comment feature on the research projects.
